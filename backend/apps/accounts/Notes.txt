🔗 Integration with Frontend
Your frontend (React, Vue, etc.) should provide:

Renewal page at /renew/{code.id} – calls your payment API.

Unsubscribe page that reads uid and token from URL and POSTs to /api/accounts/unsubscribe/.

🧪 Testing & Rollout
Apply all migrations.

Create a test broadcast in Django admin (Draft) and hit “Send Now”.
Monitor Celery logs and email inboxes.

Manually trigger the licence expiry task once:

python
from licenses.tasks import send_license_expiry_reminders
send_license_expiry_reminders.delay()
Enable the Celery beat schedule when ready.
